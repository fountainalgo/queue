# Queue
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

####### How To use #############

const Queue = require('queue');

Queue.enqueue(10)  //To add an item
Stack.dequeue()  //To pop an item
Stack.isEmpty()  //To check whether queue is empty or not
Stack.peek()  //To pull front element
Stack.size() //To get size of Queue.
Stack.get() //To get all the elements in Queue.
